Dependencies installation notes

run the following command in a terminal:

    pip install setuptools==65.5.0 "wheel<0.40.0"

An explanation of this behavior with pip program can be found [here](://stackoverflow.com/questions/76129688/why-is-pip-install-gym-failing-with-python-setup-py-egg-info-did-not-run-succ)


Visualization notes
===================
We raccomand to run the program with a ***light mode*** theme on your machine, to avoid visualization problems.
